Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini (Zulu: ['zandile 'ɮamini]; born October 21, 1995), known professionally as Doja Cat (/ˈdoʊdʒə/), is an American rapper and singer. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she began making and releasing music on SoundCloud as a teenager. Her song "So High" caught the attention of Kemosabe and RCA Records, with whom she signed a recording contract prior to the release of her debut extended play, Purrr! in 2014.

After a hiatus from releasing music and the uneventful rollout of her debut studio album, Amala (2018), Doja Cat earned viral success as an internet meme with her 2018 single "Mooo!", a novelty song in which she makes humorous claims about being a cow. Capitalizing on her growing popularity, she released her second studio album, Hot Pink, in the following year. The album later reached the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and spawned the single "Say So"; its remix featuring Nicki Minaj topped the Billboard Hot 100. Her third studio album, Planet Her (2021), spent four weeks at number two on the Billboard 200 and spawned the top ten singles "Kiss Me More" (featuring SZA), "Need to Know", and "Woman". Her fourth studio album, Scarlet (2023), adopted a hip hop-oriented sound and peaked within the top five of the Billboard 200, while its lead single "Paint the Town Red" became her most successful song to date, as it marked her first solo number-one on the Hot 100 among eight other countries.

Described by The Wall Street Journal as "a skilled technical rapper with a strong melodic sense and a bold visual presence",[1] Doja Cat is known for creating videos and performances which achieve virality on social media platforms such as TikTok. Well-versed in Internet culture, she is also famed for her absurdist online personality and stage presence.[2][3][4][5] She has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including one Grammy Award from sixteen nominations, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, and five MTV Video Music Awards. She is one of the biggest commercial artists of the 2020s according to Billboard,[6] and was included on the 100 most influential people in the world by Time in 2023.[7]

Early life
Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini[8] was born on October 21, 1995,[9] in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.[10] Her mother, Deborah Sawyer, is an American graphic designer of Jewish heritage,[11][12] and her father, Dumisani Dlamini, is a South African performer of Zulu descent,[13] best known for starring as Crocodile in the original Broadway cast of the musical Sarafina! and the 1992 film adaptation.[14][15] The two had a brief relationship after meeting in New York City where Dumisani performed on Broadway, but he was too busy on tour to spend time with Amala and her brother.[12] He claims to have left his family in the US for South Africa out of homesickness, in the hopes that they would join him there,[16] yet Dlamini has suggested on multiple occasions that she is estranged from her father, stating that she "never met him."[17][18][19] Her father has denied these claims, claiming that he has a "healthy" relationship with his daughter and that her management team had tried to block all his attempts to contact her out of the fear that they "might lose her."[20][16]

Soon after her birth, Dlamini moved from Tarzana to Rye, New York, where she lived for five years with her maternal grandmother, an architect and painter.[12][21] At the age of eight, Dlamini moved with her mother and brother and returned to California to live at the Sai Anantam Ashram, a commune in Agoura Hills,[12] and practiced Hinduism for four years.[22][23] While living at the commune, Dlamini started wearing head-covering scarves and singing bhajans at temple,[10] yet disclosed how she felt like she could not "be a kid" during her time there.[24][22] Her family then moved to Oak Park,[12] where she started attending dance lessons and experienced a "sporty childhood", often skateboarding and visiting Malibu for surf camps.[25][26] Dlamini and her brother were also subjected to racial prejudice as some of the only mixed-race children in the area.[12]

As she grew older and moved away from the ashram, she attended breakdancing classes and joined a professional poplocking troupe, with whom she competed in dance battles throughout Los Angeles while still attending high school.[27] Her aunt, a vocal coach, had given Dlamini singing lessons to help her audition for Central Los Angeles Area New High School #9, a performing arts high school in Los Angeles.[26][12][28] She frequently skipped school to participate in online chatrooms.[29] After becoming discouraged about her education and career path, Dlamini claims that she realized in eleventh grade that "performing and music was all [she] ever cared about."[30] She eventually dropped out at age 16 while in her junior year,[31] attributing this decision to her struggles with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), saying that "it felt like I was stuck in one spot and everybody else was progressing constantly."[12]

Career
2012–2017: Career beginnings and record deal
Doja Cat has described life after dropping out of school as "messy", claiming that she slept on the floor and spent "all night and day" browsing the internet, looking for beats and instrumentals from YouTube which she downloaded and used to create her own music.[32][33] After becoming fascinated with internet culture and websites like eBaum's World and Myspace,[30] she taught herself to sing, rap and use GarageBand while at home without a job, frequently making music and uploading it to SoundCloud.[27][33][32] In late 2012, "So High" became the first permanent upload on her SoundCloud account.[32] Doja Cat began her career in the Los Angeles underground hip-hop scene, performing at parties and cyphers, and connecting with rappers such as Busdriver, Ill Camille and VerBS, the latter of whom claims to have helped hone her craft and find her first gig.[34] It was during this time that she met producer Jerry "Tizhimself" Powell, who had stumbled upon her SoundCloud account.[34] He introduced her to record producer Yeti Beats,[34] who invited her to record at his studio in the neighbourhood of Echo Park, which also served as "an oasis of sorts for Doja to escape from the turmoil at home".[12] Yeti Beats then connected her with Kemosabe Records, an imprint of RCA Records, where she signed under label executive Dr. Luke and his publishing company Prescription Songs at the age of 17.[10][21][35][36] This deal also came with a temporary artist management partnership with Roc Nation.[21]

In August 2014, Doja Cat released her debut EP, Purrr!, described as "spacey, eastern-influenced R&B" by The Fader.[37] "So High" was repackaged and released as her solo commercial debut single prior to the EP's release,[35] and was later featured on the Fox series Empire in the third episode of the show's first season.[38] In mid-2015, Doja Cat temporarily signed to OG Maco's label, OGG.[39] Following the signing, in late 2016, Maco and Doja Cat collaborated on the song "Monster", from Maco's 2017 mixtape, Children of The Rage.[40] She had started experiencing writer's block, which led her to decline American singer Billie Eilish's offer to feature on what would later become her popular 2017 single "Bellyache".[41] Doja Cat would stop releasing music for a while amid what she describes as a "creative limbo", which was influenced by her record labels not paying her much attention, as well as the effects of "finding herself" and smoking too much marijuana.[12]

2018–2019: Amala and "Mooo!"

Her first major commercial release in four years, Doja Cat released the song "Roll with Us" in February 2018 following a brief hiatus.[42] The following month, she released "Go to Town" as the lead single from her debut album, with an accompanying music video.[43] "Candy" was released as the album's second single that same month.[44] The track would later become a sleeper hit after a "dance challenge" on the video-sharing platform TikTok went viral in late 2019.[45] The single consequently charted in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, with the latter having the song peak at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100, making this her first solo entry on the chart.[46]

On March 30, 2018, Doja Cat's debut studio album Amala was released through RCA and Kemosabe Records, and included the three singles.[47] Its release was largely uneventful,[48][49] as it was ignored by critics and failed to chart in any market.[50][51] Doja Cat has since expressed strong disdain toward the record, claiming that it doesn't entirely represent her as an artist and that it isn't a "finished album" since she was constantly partying or high on marijuana during its recording.[52][53][54] She claims it was also rushed in order to meet deadlines from the record labels who paid it "almost no support".[55]

In August 2018, Doja Cat self-published the homemade music video for "Mooo!", a novelty song with absurdist lyrics in which she fantasizes about being a cow.[56] The video promptly garnered viral success as an internet meme, attaining over three million views in one week.[57][58][59] Due to popular demand following this viral success, the single version of "Mooo!" was released onto digital platforms later that month as the lead single from the deluxe edition of Amala.[60] This was followed by the release of the second single, "Tia Tamera" featuring Rico Nasty, and its accompanying music video in February 2019.[61] The full deluxe edition of Amala was released on March 1, 2019, and featured the bonus tracks "Mooo!", "Tia Tamera" and "Juicy".[51] The success of "Mooo!" is believed to have "irrefutably proved" to her record labels that Doja Cat was a marketable artist, which led them to start paying more attention to her.[12]

2019–2020: Breakthrough with Hot Pink

A remix version of Doja Cat's song "Juicy", from the deluxe version of Amala, added a verse from American rapper Tyga and was released alongside a music video in August 2019 as the lead single from her second studio album.[62] Following the release of the remix, the song debuted at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Doja Cat's first entry on the chart, and ultimately peaked at number 41.[51] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) would later award the song a platinum certification in the United States.[63] The song's success led to Amala debuting for the first time on the Billboard 200 chart that same month.[51] In October 2019, Doja Cat released "Bottom Bitch", the second single from her second album.[64] This was followed by the release of the single "Rules" alongside the announcement of her second studio album Hot Pink.[65] Hot Pink was released on November 7, 2019, to generally favorable reviews. The album would eventually peak at number 9 on the Billboard 200.[66] Doja Cat was meant to feature on a track titled "Broward Coward" from an early version of the late XXXTentacion's fourth studio album, Bad Vibes Forever,[67][68] however the song was ultimately scrapped when the album tracklist was completely revised for its posthumous release in December 2019.[69] She later released the single "Boss Bitch" as part of the soundtrack for the 2020 film Birds of Prey.[70]

Doja Cat adopted a more experimental image ahead of Scarlet's release
In early 2023, Doja Cat began teasing her fourth studio album with the working title of Hellmouth.[178] Prior to this, she had asserted that the album would be "predominantly rap", a callback to the musical style of her earliest works,[179] and an effort to diverge from the "pink and soft things" and "pop and glittery sounds" that she has become noted for,[180] notably denouncing her previous two albums as "cash grabs" and "digestible pop hits".[181] She also adopted a darker aesthetic and appearance, which she described as "punk", "experimental" and "manic",[182] while some fans deemed these changes "demonic",[183][184] and accused her of being a Satanist,[185][186] and a member of the Illuminati.[187][188] In mid-June 2023, she released the album's first promotional single, titled "Attention", alongside an accompanying music video directed by Tanu Muino.[189] The album's lead single, "Paint the Town Red", was released in early August 2023 to commercial success, breaking a number of streaming records,[125][190] and becoming her first solo song to top the charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom,[191][192] among several other countries and the Billboard Global 200 chart.[193] The album's title was later revealed to be Scarlet in mid-August 2023.[182] The second promotional single, "Demons", was released in early September 2023, alongside a music video directed by Christian Breslauer and co-starring American actress Christina Ricci.[194] Scarlet was released to mostly positive reviews on September 22, 2023,[195][196] and debuted within the top 5 in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

Artistry
Influences

Doja Cat has named Nicki Minaj (pictured) as her biggest influence
Doja Cat has cited Nicki Minaj as her biggest influence.[198][199] In a Billboard interview, Doja Cat stated that she is "in love with everything Nicki Minaj has put out into the world."[200] On the song "Get Into It (Yuh)" from her third studio album, Planet Her (2021), she pays tribute to Minaj and borrows lyrics and rap delivery from her debut 2010 single "Massive Attack".[201][202] Critics noted that the album as whole was largely influenced by Minaj herself[203][204][205] with The New Yorker noting that she "build[s] upon the pop-rap legacy established by her predecessor Nicki Minaj".[206] She has also named Lauryn Hill and Busta Rhymes as some of her biggest influences.[207][208] While speaking about Busta Rhymes, she stated: "if I hear a beat Busta Rhymes would absolutely kill, I'll use my voice to do a flow similar to his."[54]

Additionally, Doja Cat has cited Rihanna,[209][35] Beyoncé,[210][211] D'Angelo,[209] Missy Elliott,[212] Christina Aguilera,[213] Pharrell Williams,[214] and Lil' Kim[215] among her major influences. She draws inspiration from her background engaging in online activities and delving into sub-cultures as a suburban teenager,[29] as well as the artists her mother exposed to her as a child such as Fugees, Erykah Badu, Jamiroquai, Earth, Wind & Fire, Black Eyed Peas, Seal, Tupac, Aaliyah, DMX, India Arie, and TLC.[54][216][21] The Hindu culture of her childhood as well as Japanese culture have also been noted as sources of inspiration for Purrr! (2014) and other aspects of her early career.[217][218] In an interview with Big Boy, she stated her admiration for Janet Jackson and Prince.[211]

Stage name and persona

Doja Cat at the Met Gala in 2023
As a teenager in 2012, Doja Cat gained her stage name from one of her cats as well as her favorite strain of marijuana, stating, "I was heavily addicted to weed and weed culture, so when I began rapping I thought of the word 'doja' and how it sounds like a girl's name."[27] She has since expressed slight disdain towards the name and the persona that it carries, stating in November 2021 that "my image was the pothead hippie girl, and I'm not that."[41]

Musical style and themes
Doja Cat's music has been described as hip hop,[209][213] pop,[10] R&B,[213] and pop rap.[219] When asked about her legacy, Doja Cat revealed that in future she would like to be remembered for her versatility in not only music but also visual art and dance.[25] Her second full-length studio album, Hot Pink, is built with her own beats as well as a series of videos written and conceived by herself.[29] She claimed the era was a firm restart for her career, and the most "refined, chiseled" representation of herself. Her escapist fantasy worldview is reflected in the music by its upbeat production style.[29] The record was inspired by drastic lifestyle changes including an "illuminating" acid trip which made her quit smoking cigarettes and marijuana.[29]

Her 2021 song "Naked" contains a tongue-in-cheek sexual reference that refers to bisexuality in that she "like[s] bananas and peaches",[220] while her 2019 single "Bottom Bitch" can also be interpreted as a metaphor for lesbian sex.[221]

Personal life
Doja Cat is reported to be "eager to deflect interest in her personal life."[222] She lived in a home in Beverly Hills, California, which she bought in 2021 for $2.2 million[223] and sold in September 2022 for $2.5 million.[224]
