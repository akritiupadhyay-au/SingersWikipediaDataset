Ariana Grande-Butera (/ˌɑːriˈɑːnə ˈɡrɑːndeɪ bjʊˈtɛərə/ AR-ee-AH-nə GRAHN-day byuu-TAIR-ə;[note 1] born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Regarded as a pop icon, she is noted as an influential figure in popular music and as one of the most prominent vocalists of her generation for her four-octave vocal range and signature whistle register. Grande has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including one Brit Award, two Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 35 Guinness World Records. Rolling Stone ranked her amongst the greatest singers of all time.

Grande began her career at age 15 by appearing in the Broadway musical 13 (2008). She rose to prominence for her performance as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013), and signed with Republic Records in 2011. Grande's debut studio album, Yours Truly (2013), incorporated retro-pop and R&B elements and yielded the successful single "The Way". My Everything (2014), her second album, experimented with EDM and catapulted her to worldwide stardom through the singles "Problem", "Break Free", and "Bang Bang". Grande further explored pop and R&B with her third album Dangerous Woman (2016), which solidified her critical and commercial success.

Personal struggles influenced Grande's trap-infused fourth and fifth albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019). The former won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while the latter broke several streaming records and was nominated for Album of the Year. It garnered two Billboard Hot 100 number-one songs with its title track and "7 Rings", and made Grande the first soloist to simultaneously occupy the top three positions on the chart. She broke the record for the most number-one debuts in Hot 100 history with the title track of her sixth album, Positions (2020), and the collaborations "Stuck with U" with Justin Bieber and "Rain on Me" with Lady Gaga, which won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande achieved three further number-ones with two The Weeknd collaborations and "Yes, And?" from her upcoming seventh album, Eternal Sunshine (2024). She returned to acting with the political satire Don't Look Up (2021), and will star as Glinda in the upcoming two-part film adaptation of Wicked (2024–2025).

Among the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 90 million records, all of Grande's studio albums have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America. She has broken a variety of records on the Billboard charts with her albums, songs and as an artist. Having amassed 98 billion streams thus far, Grande is one of the most streamed artists of all time and the most streamed female artist, as of 2021. She was the most-streamed female artist of the 2010s and has currently the most one billion songs for a female artist, with 14 on Spotify. Grande also has a large social media following; with over 380 million followers, she is the sixth-most-followed individual on Instagram and one of the most-subscribed and most followed musicians on YouTube and Spotify. She was named Woman of the Year (2018) and the most successful female artist to debut in the 2010s by Billboard, featured in listicles such as Time 100 (2016 and 2019), Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019–2020), and ranked the highest-paid female musician of 2020 by Forbes. Outside of music and film, Grande has worked with many charitable organizations and advocates for animal rights, mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Her business ventures include R.E.M. Beauty, a cosmetics brand launched in 2021, and a fragrance line that has earned over $1 billion in global retail sales.

Early life
Ariana Grande-Butera was born on June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida.[2][3] She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment owned by the Grande family since 1964,[4] and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton.[5][6] Grande is of Italian[7] descent and has described herself as an Italian American with Sicilian and Abruzzese roots.[8] She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an entertainer and producer.[9] Her family moved from New York to Florida before her birth, and her parents separated when she was eight or nine years old.[6] Grande has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.[10]

On October 9, 1998, during the inaugural regular-season hockey game of the Florida Panthers at National Car Rental Center, Grande became the first child to ever ride a Zamboni in the brand-new arena during the first intermission, the result of her parents' $200 winning bid at an auction.[11] A photograph of her on the Zamboni was featured in the South Florida SunSentinel the next day.[12] At age 8, she sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Panthers' home game against the Chicago Blackhawks on January 16, 2002.[13]

As a young child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater,[14] playing her first role as the title character in the musical Annie. She also performed in their productions of The Wizard of Oz and Beauty and the Beast.[7][15] At age eight, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras.[16] During this time, she attended the Pine Crest School and later North Broward Preparatory.[17]

Career
2008–2012: Career beginnings and Nickelodeon
By age 13, Grande became serious about pursuing a music career, although she still concentrated on theater.[18] When she first arrived in Los Angeles, California to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: "I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'"[6] In 2008, Grande was cast as cheerleader Charlotte in the Broadway musical 13.[19][20] When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent her materials to study with tutors.[21] She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.[22]


Grande at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival
Grande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show Victorious along with 13 co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009.[23] In the sitcom, set at a performing arts high school, she played the "adorably dimwitted" Cat Valentine.[7][23] She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role, which severely damaged her hair.[24] The show premiered in March 2010 to the second-largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon, with 5.7 million viewers.[25][26] The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, saying that acting is "fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me."[27] Her character was compared to "Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in Clueless" and described as being "very impressionable and easily swayed" but "generally sweet".[28]

After the first season of Victorious wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010.[29] To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro.[30] The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the show's highest-rated episode.[31] In May 2011, Grande appeared in Greyson Chance's video for the song "Unfriend You" from his album Hold On 'til the Night (2011), portraying his ex-girlfriend. She made her first musical appearance on the track "Give It Up" from the Victorious soundtrack in August 2011. While filming Victorious, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube.[32] A friend of Monte Lipman, chief executive officer (CEO) of Republic Records, came across one of the videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract.[6] Grande voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film Snowflake, the White Gorilla in November 2011.[33][34] From 2011 to 2013, she voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in the Nickelodeon revival of Winx Club.[35]

In December 2011, Grande released her first single, "Put Your Hearts Up", which was recorded for a potential teen-oriented pop album that was never issued.[36] She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying she had no interest in recording music of that genre.[36] The song was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[37] On a second soundtrack, Victorious 2.0, released on June 5, 2012, as an extended play, she supplied vocals as part of the show's cast for the song "5 Fingaz to the Face".[38] The third and final soundtrack, Victorious 3.0, was released on November 6, 2012, which featured a duet by Grande and Victoria Justice titled "L.A. Boyz", with an accompanying music video being released shortly after.[39] In December 2012, Grande collaborated on the single version of "Popular Song", a duet with British singer and songwriter Mika.[40][41][42]

After four seasons, Victorious was not renewed,[43] with the finale airing in February 2013. Grande starred as Snow White in the pantomime-style musical theatre production A Snow White Christmas with Charlene Tilton and Neil Patrick Harris at the Pasadena Playhouse.[44] She played Amanda Benson in Swindle, a 2013 Nickelodeon film adaptation of the children's book of the same name.[34][45] Meanwhile, Nickelodeon created Sam & Cat, an iCarly and Victorious spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande.[46] Grande and McCurdy reprised their roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom, which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business.[47] The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the network immediately picked up the show.[48] The next month, Nickelodeon doubled Sam & Cat's original 20-episode order for season one, making it a 40-episode season.[49] Despite its success in the ratings, the series was canceled after 35 episodes.[50] The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.[51]

Artistry
Musical style
Grande's music is generally pop and R&B with elements of EDM, hip hop,[258][259][260][261] and trap,[262][263][264] the latter first appearing prominently on her Christmas & Chill extended play. While consistently maintaining pop and R&B tones, she has increasingly incorporated trap into her music as her career has progressed,[265] thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown.[266] She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that "one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same."[267] Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she "love[s] being hands on" with every project, revealing that rapper Mac Miller first taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools.[268] Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music "from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals."[269] She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[270]

Grande's debut album Yours Truly was complimented for recreating the R&B "vibe and feel of the 90s" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[271] Her follow-up record, My Everything, explored EDM and electropop genres.[272] Grande expanded the pop and R&B sound on her third album, Dangerous Woman, which was praised by the Los Angeles Times for integrating elements of different styles, such as reggae-pop ("Side to Side"), dance-pop ("Be Alright"), and guitar-trap fusion ("Sometimes").[273] Trap-pop was more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener and Thank U, Next.[265] Elias Leight of Rolling Stone opined that Grande "set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming" and "embrace[d] the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop" on Sweetener, exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity.[274][275] Craig Jenkins of Vulture noted that she embraced trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on Thank U, Next,[276] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[275] Her sixth album, Positions, further emphasized the R&B and trap-pop sound of its two predecessors, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.[277][278]

Influences
Mariah Carey
Whitney Houston
Grande credits Mariah Carey (left) and Whitney Houston (right) as her major vocal influences.
Grande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.[259] She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[279] Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her primary vocal influences: "I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it."[280][281] Grande was also influenced vocally by Destiny's Child, Beyoncé,[282] Celine Dion and Madonna.[283] She reflected on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album Let's Talk About Love on her social media.[284] Grande credits Madonna with "pav[ing] the way for me and also every other female artist" and admitted to being "obsessed with her entire discography".[285][286]

Musically, Grande admires India Arie because her "music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay", loves Brandy's songs because "her riffs are incredibly on point," and praised Imogen Heap's "intricate" song structure.[275] Grande also named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring her ability to tell "a story when she sings",[275] and named "Over the Rainbow" as one of the first songs she remembers singing because "Wizard Of Oz was always my favorite movie when I was younger."[280] Music producer and collaborator Savan Kotecha stated that he and Grande were influenced by Lauryn Hill when creating her fourth album Sweetener and its lead single "No Tears Left to Cry".[287] Kotecha told Variety, "we were listening to Lauryn Hill about chord changes and why we stick to four chords all the time".[288]

Grande expressed admiration for rappers' unconventional music release strategy. She told Billboard, "My dream has always been to be—obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do."[262] It inspired her to release "Thank U, Next" without any prior announcement, which The Ringer called "more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move."[289]

Voice
Grande has been described as a soprano,[290][291][292] possessing a four-octave vocal range[7][293] and a whistle register.[294] With the release of Yours Truly, critics compared Grande's wide vocal range and music to those of Mariah Carey.[295][296] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have "the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant."[297] Grande called the comparisons "a huge compliment" but noted sonic differences in her and Carey's discographies.[282] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, "With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]—and that's okay."[296]

Mark Savage of BBC News named Grande "one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers" and complimented her "unrivalled vocal control".[7] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles noted that Grande's voice "can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced."[298] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown wrote in a 2016 Time magazine article, "[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle."[299]

Public image

Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early career; however, she later found emulating Hepburn's style "a little boring".[300] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[300] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as "age appropriate" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[297] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention "for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings."[301] That year, she abandoned her earlier style in favor of short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events.[302] She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears and, more recently, oversized jackets and hoodies.[303][304][305][306] Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities.[307][308][309][310][311][312] After years of dyeing her hair red for her role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from damage.[151][313] Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her "iconic" high ponytail has received more attention than her fashion choices.[314]

Although Grande drew criticism for alleged impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014,[315] she dismissed the reports as "weird, inaccurate depictions".[316] Rolling Stone wrote: "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image."[317] In July 2015, Grande sparked controversy after being seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting", referring to a tray of doughnuts.[318] She subsequently apologized, saying that she is "EXTREMELY proud to be an American" and that her comments rather referred to obesity in the United States.[319] She later released a video apology for "behaving poorly".[320] The incident was parodied by The Muppets[321] and featured in Miley Cyrus's Saturday Night Live cover of "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015.[322] Grande herself poked fun at the incident while hosting Saturday Night Live in 2016, saying, "A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for."[7][323] In 2020, she said that she stopped doing interviews for a while out of fear that her words would be misconstrued and that she would be labeled a "diva".[324]
