Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao (/kəˈmiːlə kəˈbeɪoʊ/;[1] Latin American Spanish: [ˈkaɾla kaˈmila kaˈβeʝo esˈtɾabao]; born March 3, 1997)[2] is an American singer and songwriter.[3] She rose to prominence as a member of the girl group Fifth Harmony, which became one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. While in Fifth Harmony, Cabello began to establish herself as a solo artist with the release of the collaborations "I Know What You Did Last Summer" with Shawn Mendes and "Bad Things" with Machine Gun Kelly, the latter reaching number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. She left the group in late 2016.

Her debut studio album, Camila (2018), reached number one on the US Billboard 200. The Latin music–influenced pop album was critically well-received and earned a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its lead single "Havana" topped the charts in several countries, including Australia, the US and UK, and the follow-up single "Never Be the Same" reached the top ten in multiple countries. Cabello's 2019 duet with Mendes, "Señorita", became her second single to top the Billboard Hot 100. Her second studio album, Romance (2019), included her collab with Mendes and peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, with the single "My Oh My" peaking at number 12 on the Hot 100,[4] and inside the top ten in multiple countries.

In 2021, Cabello starred as the title character from the film Cinderella. She subsequently released her third studio album Familia in April 2022, with the lead single "Don't Go Yet" released in July 2021.[5] The second single from Familia, "Bam Bam", reached the top five of the Billboard Global 200 Chart, Cabello's highest entry and peaked inside the top ten in several countries; it also peaked at 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. Familia peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200,[4] number 9 in the UK and number 6 in Canada.

Cabello has amassed billions of streams on music platforms, and "Havana" became the best-selling digital single of 2018, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Cabello's awards include two Latin Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and one Billboard Music Award.

Early life and education
Cabello was born in the Habana del Este district of Cojímar, Havana, Cuba[6][7] to Alejandro Cabello and Sinuhe Estrabao. Her father is Mexican and was born in Mexico City, before moving to Cuba. She has a younger sister named Sofia.[8] Cabello spent much of her early life moving back-and-forth between Cuba and Mexico.[9] Camila has Mexican citizenship.[10][11]

When Cabello was six years old, she relocated to Miami, Florida with her mother, crossing the border from Mexico to the United States and taking a 36-hour Greyhound bus-ride to Miami, after waiting only one day at the border before being granted permission to enter the US. Cabello was told by her mother that she was going to Disneyworld as an incentive to go to the US; they moved into Cabello's grandfather's colleague's home, who would later become her godmother. Cabello's mother took night courses to study English. Cabello's father was unable to obtain a visa at the time, and joined the family approximately 18 months later; upon his arrival in the country, he would work washing cars in front of Dolphin Mall.

Cabello's mother—a trained architect with a degree earned in Cuba—initially worked at Marshalls, stacking shoes, until one day, two other Cuban women approached her at work and told her that they had a brother who worked in architecture; she was told that the brother needed someone who worked in AutoCAD, and Cabello's mother learned the program in a week. In time, she had earned enough money to move out of her father’s colleague’s house and into an apartment with her children. Cabello's mother and father eventually formed a construction company named after Camila and Sofia.[6][12][9][13] Cabello acquired American citizenship in 2008.[14]

Cabello attended Miami Palmetto High School, but left during the 2012–2013 school year (while she was in 9th grade) to pursue her singing career. Later, she earned her high school diploma.[15]

Career
2012–2016: The X Factor and Fifth Harmony

Camila Cabello auditioned for the TV talent competition show The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina, with Aretha Franklin's "Respect";[16][17] however, her audition was not aired because the series did not get the rights for the song. After elimination during the "bootcamp" portion of the process in Miami, Florida, Cabello was called back to the stage along with other contestants Ally Brooke, Normani, Lauren Jauregui, and Dinah Jane to form the girl group that would later become known as Fifth Harmony.[18] After finishing in third place on the show, they signed a joint deal with Syco Music, owned by Simon Cowell, and Epic Records, L.A. Reid's record label.[19][20]

The group released the EP Better Together (2013) along with the studio albums Reflection (2015) and 7/27 (2016). The latter two generated the singles "Worth It" and "Work from Home", respectively, which reached the top 10 in several international charts.[21] From 2013 through the end of 2016, Cabello performed in various tours with Fifth Harmony. In November 2015, Cabello collaborated with Canadian singer Shawn Mendes on a duet titled "I Know What You Did Last Summer", a song they wrote together.[22][23] The single charted at number 20 in the US and 18 in Canada[24] and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[25] On October 14, 2016, American rapper Machine Gun Kelly released a joint single with Cabello called "Bad Things",[26] which reached a peak of number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 songs chart.[27] Also that year, Time magazine included Cabello on "The 25 Most Influential Teens of 2016" list.[28]

On December 18, 2016, Fifth Harmony announced Cabello's departure, with both sides giving contradictory explanations of the circumstances for her exit.[29][30][31] She appeared in a previously taped performance with the group on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve at the end of 2016.[32] Writing about Cabello's time in the group, a Billboard journalist noted it is "rather uncommon for someone to stand out in a collective as much as Cabello has over the past years."[33]

On January 25, 2017, "Love Incredible", a collaboration with Norwegian DJ Cashmere Cat, leaked online.[34] The official version of the song was released on February 16 and later featured on Cashmere's debut studio album, 9 (2017).[35] Cabello also recorded "Hey Ma" with rappers Pitbull and J Balvin for The Fate of the Furious soundtrack (2017).

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised Cabello for her performance, saying "she has a real knack for comedy",[98] and IndieWire remarked, "In her cinematic debut, the pop star stitches up a charming performance in an oft-told fairy tale."[99] In an interview with The One Show in July, Cabello said she would like to continue acting.[100]

In a review for The Guardian, Alim Kheraj praised the album's vibrant Latin motifs—"honest and humming with artistic intent"—and noted the recurring theme of "self-sabotage and paranoia."[citation needed]
