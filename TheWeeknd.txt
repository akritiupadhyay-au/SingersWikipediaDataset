Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (Amharic: አበል መኮነን ተስፋዬ; born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer.[2][3] He is noted for his unconventional music production, artistic reinventions, and his signature use of the falsetto register.[4][5]

Born and raised in Toronto, Tesfaye began his career in 2009 by anonymously releasing music on YouTube. Two years later, he co-founded the record label XO and released the mixtapes House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, which gained recognition for his style of contemporary and alternative R&B as well as the mystique surrounding his identity.[6] In 2012, he signed with Republic Records and re-issued the mixtapes for his compilation album Trilogy. He explored dark wave for his debut studio album Kiss Land (2013), which debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. After its release, Tesfaye began contributing to film soundtracks; his acclaimed 2014 single "Earned It" from Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.[7]

Tesfaye earned critical and commercial success with his pop-leaning second album Beauty Behind the Madness (2015), which reached number one in the US, contained the US Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles "Can't Feel My Face" and "The Hills," and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album in addition to a nomination for Album of the Year.[8] His trap-infused third album Starboy (2016) saw similar commercial success and included the US number-one lead single of the same name (featuring Daft Punk) and "Die for You," and won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Tesfaye would return to alternative R&B with his debut extended play, My Dear Melancholy (2018), which contained the US top-ten single "Call Out My Name."[9] He explored new wave and dream pop with his fourth studio album After Hours (2020), which featured the chart record-setting single "Blinding Lights" and the US number-one singles: "Heartless" and "Save Your Tears."[10] Dance-pop inspired his fifth album Dawn FM (2022), which included the US top-ten single "Take My Breath." In 2023, he co-created and starred in the drama series The Idol, which was critically panned, although its accompanying soundtrack found modest commercial success.

Among the world's best-selling music artists with over 75 million records sold,[11] Tesfaye holds several streaming and Billboard chart records.[12][13] He is the first Canadian artist to earn four diamond-certified singles from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[14][15] "Blinding Lights" became the most-streamed song in Spotify history and the best-performing song in the Billboard Hot 100's history, as well as the longest charting song by a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100.[16][17] Tesfaye was listed by Time as one of the world's most influential people in 2020, and was dubbed the "world's most popular artist" by Guinness World Records in 2023.[18][19] An advocate for racial equality and food security, he was appointed a World Food Programme Goodwill Ambassador in 2021.[20][21] His accolades include four Grammy Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 22 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and a Latin Grammy Award, as well as nominations for an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.

Early life
Abel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[22] He is the only child of Ethiopian Amhara immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[24][25] He was raised in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[22][26] He has an estranged relationship with his father, telling Rolling Stone in 2015 that "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there."[25]

Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox.[25][27] When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to Variety in 2020, "I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things."[28] His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.[29] He later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school.[30] He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[31]

When he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[32] He has described this period as being like the 1995 film Kids "without the AIDS", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[22][33] He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to "smarten up, to focus."[34][35]

Tesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup.[36] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a "crutch" for him when it came to writing music.[37] In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being "sober lite", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: "I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there."[38]

Career
2009–2011: Early beginnings
Main articles: House of Balloons, Thursday (album), and Echoes of Silence
In August 2009, Tesfaye began anonymously releasing music on YouTube.[39][40] The following year, he met Jeremy Rose, a producer who had an idea for a dark contemporary R&B project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. Rose produced three songs – "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Party & The After Party" – and others that Tesfaye had sung on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would be credited for them.[41] In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Morning" to YouTube under the username "xoxxxoooxo".[42][43] His identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from rapper Drake.[41][44] The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times.[45]

Before adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under the aliases the Noise and Kin Kane, with music from "the Noise" being leaked in May 2011.[25][46] His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, "left one weekend and never came home." However, Rose claims the name was his idea.[27][47] The last 'e' was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.[48] In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity, his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him.[49][50][51]

In 2011, Tesfaye met music executives Wassim "Sal" Slaiby and Amir "Cash" Esmailian, with whom, along with Taylor, he founded the XO record label.[52] On March 21, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape House of Balloons.[53][54][55] The mixtape included production from producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although he did not receive production credits.[41] House of Balloons was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[56] On August 18, Tesfaye released his second mixtape Thursday, which received generally positive reviews.[57] His third mixtape, Echoes of Silence, was released on December 21. It was a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize.[58][59]

In July 2011, Tesfaye held his first live performance at the Mod Club Theatre in Toronto.[60] After the performance, Drake met with Tesfaye to discuss collaborations, which led to Tesfaye earning an appearance at his OVO Festival.[61] He also participated in concerts hosted by the Black Student Association at the University of Toronto.[51] Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's second studio album Take Care, which was released on November 15, as a songwriter, producer and a featured artist on the album's seventh single "Crew Love".[62]

It also debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, with similar sales.[75][76] The album was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double-platinum by Music Canada.[77][78] It also earned Tesfaye a nomination for the Sound of 2013 poll award by BBC.[79]

The Weeknd's haunted house as part of Universal's Halloween Horror Nights.
On March 20, the Weeknd played in an episode of the cartoon The Simpsons.[241] On April 18, he headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival for the second time, performing alongside Swedish House Mafia.[242][243] On July 26, 2022, the Weeknd announced that he would host a haunted house at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood, as part of Universal's Halloween Horror Nights hosted every Halloween.[244] His song "Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength)," from Avatar: The Way of Water (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on December 16, 2022.

On February 24, 2023, following months-long renewed interest in and virality of the Weeknd's 2016 song "Die for You," which began charting in 2022 and reached a new peak of 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 6 years after its release, a remix of the song featuring Ariana Grande was released. The remix marked their fourth collaboration.[245][246] In the Billboard Hot 100 issue dated March 11, 2023, the remix reached the top of the chart, becoming both artists' seventh number one hit.[247] On February 27, 2023, in the wake of the remix's success, the Weeknd became the first artist to surpass 100 million monthly listeners on Spotify.[248]

On March 3, 2023, the Weeknd released his first live album, titled Live at SoFi Stadium.[249] It featured recordings from his HBO concert film of the same name, showcasing the last concert of the North American leg of his After Hours til Dawn Tour at SoFi Stadium. He subsequently featured on four songs — "Artificial Intelligence," "Defame Moi," "More Coke!!," and "Emotionless" — from Mike Dean's album 4:23, released on April 29, 2023. In May 2023, the Weeknd stated that he was intending to retire the moniker of "the Weeknd" in favor of performing under his birth name, or adopting a new pseudonym altogether. He explained that his upcoming album would most likely serve as his "final hurrah" under the name.[250]

The Weeknd co-created the HBO drama series The Idol with Sam Levinson, and stars in the show alongside Lily-Rose Depp. The series premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival out of competition, where it received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of onscreen nudity and sexual content. The series debuted to widespread negative reviews from critics. The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series confirms the allegations that "Instead of subtly skewering the misogynistic and predatory nature of the business, The Idol became a forbidden love story — the stuff of a toxic man’s fantasy", and called it "regressive rather than transgressive".[251] He received negative reviews for his acting, with critic Robert Daniels of The Playlist writing, "Tesfaye is also a terrible actor. He lacks the comfortability, the gravitas, charisma, and charm to increase the viability of Jocelyn being attracted to him. In most scenes, Tesfaye either hides under the cover of dim lighting, obtrusive coverage, or re-recorded dialogue dubbed into several scenes."[252] On August 28, 2023, HBO announced it had cancelled The Idol after one season.[253]

On June 8, 2023, the Weeknd announced series of EPs featuring music from The Idol. Originally intended as a soundtrack album, each EP was released following the premiere of each episode of the show, which featured collaborations with Future, Playboi Carti, Madonna, Lil Baby, and Jennie from the South Korean girl group Blackpink.[254] Later in June he received an invitation from the Academy to become a member.[255]

Tesfaye appeared on Diddy's single "Another One of Me" on September 15, which he called his "final feature".[257][258]

Artistry
Influences



Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations.
Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations.[259] He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to "Dirty Diana" as an example.[25] His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke.[25] He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk.[260] Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) for "opening my eyes" to the music of that era.[261] "I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born", he said in an interview for Billboard. "You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound."[262]

Tesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence.[263] He has also cited Lana Del Rey,[264] David Bowie,[265] the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge,[266] 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan,[267][268] and Eminem as influences and inspirations.[269][270] When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with Variety, saying: "Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people..."[271]

Production and songwriting
Tesfaye's songs are "built around a fogged, crepuscular production",[272] and feature slow tempos,[273] rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes.[24] His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock.[274] Marc Hogan of Spin says that Tesfaye's samples tend "to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah.[275] Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of Pitchfork credits with developing "a state-of-the-art R&B template" with the artist.[273] In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.[24]

His emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex,[272] drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in After Hours and House of Balloons.[24] Hermione Hoby of The Guardian characterizes Tesfaye's songs as "narcotised-slow jams" and delineates their message as "partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling."[272] Paul MacInnes of The Guardian stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as "a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover."[276] Anupa Mistry of the Toronto Standard observes throughout his mixtapes a "cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable."[24] Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is "paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent."[277]

Voice and music style
Tesfaye often sings in a falsetto register.[278] J. D. Considine finds his singing's "tremulous quality" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's "strong basis in the blues" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma.[274] Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G♯ (G♯5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave.[279][280] Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave.[280] Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of Pitchfork notes that "his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers."[281] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[282]

Tesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative, and new wave genres.[283] His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles.[284][71] Mistry writes that he "will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B."[24] Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with Time in 2015, stating: "Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from House of Balloons in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand."[285] Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others.[286][287] His debut studio album Kiss Land is categorized as R&B and dark wave.[288] His next three albums, Beauty Behind the Madness, Starboy and After Hours, are considered R&B and pop; with Starboy utilizing heavy trap influences,[289][290] and After Hours drawing on new wave and dream pop influences.[291][292] Tesfaye's fifth studio album Dawn FM explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.[293][294]

Controversies
Plagiarism allegations
In December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, which alleged that the bassline for "The Hills" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for the 2013 science fiction film The Machine.[295] One of the producers of the song was alleged to have sent a private Twitter message to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score, to tell him about the sample.[296] In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm for "Starboy" from Ethiopian poet and singer-songwriter Yasminah.[297] Tesfaye denied the allegations.[298]

In April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover, and Scott McCulloch, who accused Tesfaye of copyright infringement from plagiarising their song "I Need to Love" in order to create his song "A Lonely Night". They sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Belly. In August 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed via summary judgment with the option to amend, with the court ruling that they had failed to show that Tesfaye or anyone else involved in making "A Lonely Night" had access to their song or that the works were substantially similar.[299] In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended claim based on secondary infringement, which is still in litigation.[300][301]

In February 2020, Tesfaye and Kendrick Lamar were sued by the now-defunct indie band Yeasayer, claiming that "Pray for Me" includes an unauthorized sample of their song "Sunrise".[302] Later that year, Yeasayer voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit.[303] In September 2021, Tesfaye, Nicolás Jaar, and Frank Dukes were sued for copyright infringement by producers Suniel Fox and Henry Strange, protesting that "Call Out My Name" is "strikingly [or] substantially similar, if not identical" to their 2015 track "Vibeking".[304][305]

Allegations of homophobic lyrics
In January 2019, Tesfaye was criticized for some of the lyrics in his and Gesaffelstein's single "Lost in the Fire". The second verse of the song, with the lines "You said you might be into girls, said you're going through a phase / Keeping your heart safe / Well, baby, you can bring a friend / She can ride on top your face / While I fuck you straight", were accused of being homophobic, fetishizing bisexuality, and perpetuating the falsehood that a person who identifies as being part of the LGBTQ+ community can be "turned straight".[306][307] Tesfaye subtly addressed the controversy in the song "Snowchild" from After Hours, with the lines "Every month another accusation / Only thing I'm phobic of is failing".[308][309]

The Idol allegations
On March 1, 2023, Rolling Stone released a lengthy exposé on the working conditions and set life of the HBO drama series The Idol, a series in which Tesfaye stars, co-created and co-wrote alongside Sam Levinson. The series received significant controversy for its graphic depiction of sexual content which critics labeled "torture porn". The series was originally directed by Amy Seimetz who suddenly "exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished". The series saw a major creative overhaul, as it was reported that Tesfaye felt the show had too much of a "female perspective". Over 14 crew members alleged a toxic work environment with one adding "What I signed up for was a dark satire of fame and the fame model in the 21st century..." however, "It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing." Sources alleged that Seimetz’s approach to the story was scrapped and the show became "like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better".[310]

In response to the allegations, Tesfaye mocked the reporting on his Twitter account, posting a clip of the characters in the show discussing the magazine saying, "Rolling Stone? Aren't they a little irrelevant?". Tesfaye posted the comment in the caption: "@Rolling Stone did we upset you?".[311][312] Tesfaye's response received widespread criticism.[313] In an interview with Vanity Fair, he continued to dismiss the reporting, saying that logistical difficulties with Seimetz's schedule and production timelines, as well as a desire not to rush his first show, propelled the overhaul.[314]

Personal life
Tesfaye prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye.[371][372] In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities.[373] He prefers to be interviewed only in rare situations.[374]
