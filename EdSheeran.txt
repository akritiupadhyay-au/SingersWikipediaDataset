2023–present: - ("Subtract") and Autumn Variations
On 1 March 2023, Sheeran officially announced on all social media platforms that his sixth studio album, - ("Subtract"), would be released on 5 May 2023.[196][197] Sheeran released the album's lead single, "Eyes Closed" with its accompanying music video on 24 March 2023.[198] "Boat" was released as the second single off the record on 21 April 2023.[199] The third single, "Life Goes On", was released on 5 May 2023.[200]

Musical style and influences

Sheeran appeared on stage with one of his idols Eric Clapton (pictured) at the Nippon Budokan Arena in Tokyo, Japan on 13 April 2016 performing Clapton's "I Will Be There"
Sheeran's musical style has been described as pop,[7][203][204] folk-pop,[203][205][206] and soft rock.[207] Sheeran also incorporates rap into his music.[203] Sheeran's earliest memories include listening to the records of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elton John's Greatest Hits.[48] According to Sheeran, the album that introduced him to music was Van Morrison's Irish Heartbeat.[21] During his childhood his father took him to live concerts that would inspire his musical creations. These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan.[208] On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, "He's the reason I started playing guitar".[26] He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, "I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for £30 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff."[209]

In a complicated world, Sheeran's musical modus operandi is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They're for life's big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He's also malleable – when he's done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn't need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn't to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon.

— Michael Cragg in The Guardian on Sheeran's style of music and mass appeal.[210]
Sheeran has also cited the Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[211][212] He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.[213][214] As a teenager, he also had a Kerrang! subscription.[215] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP for helping him stammer less.[216] He was also inspired by "Cannonball" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, "seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk."[217] He also played the guitar to Westlife's Greatest Hits album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[218][219] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to People magazine, "I sang on Eric Clapton's album I Still Do. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso', appearing as a guest on Clapton's 'I Will Be There', in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on 'Dive' on Sheeran's album ÷ and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso'."[26] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[220]

Charity work
Sheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. "It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else," Sheeran said. "There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve." Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[228]


Sheeran often wears hoodies or tartan shirts, and frequently donates his clothes to charity shops in Suffolk.
Sheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[229] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[230] In 2016, he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[231] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in Bridget Jones's Baby, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[231]

The donations, which have been made over a two-year period via the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation, helped the school to purchase items such as MacBooks, cameras and a photography darkroom.[238] The same month, Sheeran made a donation to Ipswich Hospital.[239] In June 2020, Sheeran made a "founding gift" to launch Suffolk Community Foundation's "Rebuilding Local Lives Appeal" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the celebration day of the county, "Suffolk Day". Sheeran has donated over £1 million to local charities in Suffolk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including to a children's hospital ward.[240]

Sheeran's parents organised The Ed Sheeran Made in Suffolk Legacy Auction on 23 October 2020 which ran until 8 November. The auction had 220 lots, including items donated by other celebrities such as David Beckham, Kylie Minogue and Usain Bolt. Sheeran has donated some of his personal items including handwritten lyrics from his song "Perfect", lego bricks he played with as a kid, handmade You Need Me EP from 2009 and a £3 ticket to his first gig at the British Legion in Framlingham. The auction was made to raise money for Suffolk charities such as GeeWizz and Zest who both support children and young adults in the county, including redeveloping a playground for kids with special educational needs and disabilities in Ipswich. In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled "Dab 2 2020", to the same auction.[241] Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for "anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times".[242] Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties.[243]

Acting

Heinz "Edchup", released after Sheeran appeared in a 2019 advert for the company
Sheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[244] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom Undateable.[245] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap Home and Away, as a character based on himself.[246]

After recording a cover version of Foy Vance's "Make It Rain" for Sons of Anarchy, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama The Bastard Executioner on FX.[247] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film Bridget Jones's Baby in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Renée Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival.[248]

In July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on Game of Thrones opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.[249] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[250] It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews.[251][252]

In June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[253] A lifelong fan of the product—he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage "butty" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm—he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[253][254] A representative from Heinz stated that "1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014."[255] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a "super posh" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as "Heinz Edchup".[253]

Released in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film Yesterday, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[256]

Impact

Sheeran concert in Helsinki, August 2022. He had the highest-grossing tour of the 2010s, while his current tour, +–=÷x Tour, ranks among the highest-grossing of the 2020s.
Music journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran "brought pop back down to earth" with his music style, introducing himself "touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal". Noting him as "one of the most influential" artists of his generation, as he spawned "endless imitators", Petridis remarked that the music charts were "packed with Sheeran-alikes" after ×, describing it as "the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours" that reached critical mass.[257] Similarly, The Guardian writer Laura Snapes cited him as "the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired "troubadours" to enter the music charts, and marked "the calcification of the everyman male pop star", and the end of record labels marketing them "exclusively to teenage girls and their mums."[258] Billboard writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting "a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success."[259] The Financial Times considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has "broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market" in the UK.[260]

iHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[259] GQ's George Chesterton deemed Sheeran "the de facto voice of a generation" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and "the defining characteristics of his audience", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding "with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity."[261] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his "lyrical candour" and his "professional hunger" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a "very clear edge" to breakthrough in a music industry that is "saturated with singer-songwriters", while Sheeran's "niche combination" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and "convince the urban crowd that he was authentic".[260] According to Vox, Sheeran has reached "global pop culture ubiquity".[262] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[263] while in 2021, The Independent said he had "one of the biggest pop careers of this generation."[264] Billboard,[265] The Financial Express,[266] The Brandon Sun[267] and Arab News[268] have cited him as a "British music icon". In a 2023 poll conducted by the O2 Priority Tickets platform on what musical acts, past and present, music fans would most want to see live, Sheeran ranked third, after Queen and the Beatles.[269] Sheeran and his work have influenced various recording artists, including Shawn Mendes,[270] Louis Tomlinson,[271] Camila Cabello[272] and Cody Simpson.[273]

Accolades
Main article: List of awards and nominations received by Ed Sheeran

In 2024 he won a Primetime Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for "A Beautiful Game" from Ted Lasso.

Personal life

Sheeran's tattoos are either connected to his family, achievements, or memories.
In early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[78][280] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[281] and Los Angeles, California.[282] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[78]

Sheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for "Drunk") in 2012, before breaking up.[283] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs "Nina" and "Photograph", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is about Sheeran.[283] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[284] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song "Thinking Out Loud".[285] They broke up in February 2015.[285] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums Red (original and re-recorded versions) and Reputation, as well as on a remix of the song "The Joker and the Queen" from Sheeran's album =.[26][286]

In July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[287] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[288][289] She is the inspiration of the song "Perfect".[290] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[291][292] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[293] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[294]

Sheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[295] and his +–=÷x Tour kit sponsored their 2021–22 season.[296] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[297] His +–=÷x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed for the 2022–23 season.[298] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[299] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[300]

In June 2015, Forbes listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[301] In July 2018, Forbes named Sheeran ninth on their list of the highest-paid celebrities.[302] According to The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth £160 million (US$207 million) as the 17th-richest musician in the UK.[303] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at £200 million in 2020.[304]

On 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[305] On 1 March 2023, he revealed that his wife, while pregnant, had developed a tumour with "no route to treatment until after the birth".[306]

Legal issues
Sheeran has faced accusations of plagiarism with regards to chord progression and other elements of his music. However, tort actions which have reached a jury have all been decided decisively in Sheeran's favour.

In 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song "Photograph" was a "note-for-note" copy of the chorus in the song "Amazing" by X Factor UK winner Matt Cardle.[307] Sheeran later regretted the decision to settle, saying that it was done on the advice of his lawyers who thought the case was "more trouble than it was worth."[308] He said he regretted settling the claim not because of the money involved, but because it changed his relationship with the song. He said: "I didn't play 'Photograph' for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty." He also thought that settling the case opened a floodgate of claims, including the "Shape of You" lawsuit.[309]

In 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song "Let's Get It On" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in "Thinking Out Loud". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found "substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements".[310] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[311]

The case, closely followed by those in music and legal circles, went to trial on in New York in April 2023. Sheeran's lawyers argued that while the two songs have similar "building blocks" and a specific chord progression, such features are true for many pop songs, and the jury found in favour of Sheeran with a unanimous verdict.[312] After winning the trial, Sheeran said: "These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let's Get It On' was written and will be used to create music long after we are all gone."[313]

Sheeran was taken also to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over "Shape of You". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed "particular lines and phrases" of their 2015 composition "Oh Why".[314] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he "neither deliberately nor subconsciously" copied a phrase from "Oh Why" when writing "Shape of You".[315][316]

Political views
Sheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported "remain". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for "a 2nd vote". Stating that Brexit will "impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation", the letter adds: "We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is."[317]

In 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the Labour Party and then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that "I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do."[318]

In 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act in order to outlaw discrimination against LGBT people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is "essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities."[319]

In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sheeran expressed support for Ukraine and participated in the Concert for Ukraine held at the Resorts World Arena in Birmingham, England.[320]
