Dua Lipa (/ˈduːə ˈliːpə/ ⓘ DOO-ə LEE-pə, Albanian: [ˈdua ˈlipa]; born 22 August 1995) is an English and Albanian[a] singer and songwriter. Her voice and disco-influenced production have received critical acclaim and media coverage. She has won numerous accolades throughout her career including six Brit Awards and three Grammy Awards.

Lipa worked as a model before signing a recording contract with Warner Bros. in 2014. She rose to prominence with her eponymous debut album in 2017, which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the successful singles "Be the One", "IDGAF", and the UK number-one single "New Rules". Lipa was honoured with the Brit Awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Her second chart-topping single, "One Kiss" with Calvin Harris, was the best-selling song of 2018 and won the Brit Award for Song of the Year. In 2019, Lipa won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and for Best Dance Recording for "Electricity", her collaborative single with Silk City.

Lipa's second album, Future Nostalgia (2020), became her first UK number-one album, and won the Brit Award for British Album of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Its lead single, "Don't Start Now", scored the longest top-ten stay for a British female artist on the UK Singles Chart and ranked in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart of 2020. The album's success continued with the follow-up singles "Physical", "Break My Heart", and "Levitating", which topped the Billboard year-end Hot 100 chart of 2021 and was certified diamond in the US. Both of Lipa's albums are the most-streamed female albums on Spotify, with over 10 billion streams each. Lipa subsequently scored her third and fourth UK number-one singles with the 2021 Elton John duet "Cold Heart (Pnau remix)" and "Dance the Night" from the soundtrack of the film Barbie (2023), where she also made her acting debut.

Early life
Lipa was born in London,[1] the eldest child of Kosovo Albanian parents Anesa (née Rexha) and Dukagjin Lipa from Pristina, FR Yugoslavia (present-day Kosovo).[2][3] Her family is Muslim.[4] Her maternal grandmother is of Bosniak descent.[5][6][7]

Her ancestry can also be traced back to the city of Peja, Kosovo. Both of her grandfathers were historians.[8] She has a sister named Rina and a brother named Gjin.[4][9][10] Lipa was musically influenced by her father,[11][12][13] who was the lead singer and guitarist of the Kosovan rock band Oda.[14][15][10] Her father continued to play music at home, including his own compositions and songs of artists such as David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Sting, The Police, and Stereophonics.[12][13][16] Dua Lipa began singing at the age of five.[17]

Lipa grew up in West Hampstead, London.[15] She attended Fitzjohn's Primary School[18][19] and her music lessons there included the cello.[3] When she auditioned to enter the school choir, the teacher told her that "she could not sing".[3][12][20] At the age of nine, she began weekend singing lessons at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.[3][5][21] Lipa moved with her family to Pristina after Kosovo declared independence in 2008.[5][17] There she attended Mileniumi i Tretë School,[22] learned more about the Albanian language, and considered a music career.[23][24]

At age 15, Lipa moved alone back to London and shared a flat with a family friend.[25][26][27][28] At Parliament Hill School she passed her A-Levels, then re-entered Sylvia Young Theatre School part-time.[27][29] She uploaded her own songs to SoundCloud and YouTube. She began posting videos of herself covering songs such as "If I Ain't Got You" (2004) by Alicia Keys and "Beautiful" (2002) by Christina Aguilera on YouTube.[17] Lipa modeled with Topshop[26] and signed with a modeling agency, helping her land a role as a "singer" in an ITV advertisement for The X Factor in 2013, covering the song "Lost in Music" (1979).[30][31] She acquired a producer and a manager.[2][27]

Music career
2013–2018: Career beginnings and Dua Lipa

Lipa in 2016
In 2013, Lipa signed a contract with Tap Management, directed by Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, while working as a waitress in a cocktail bar. Lipa was introduced to Mawson by her lawyer, who discouraged her from signing another publishing deal that was offered to her. They then offered her a monthly salary to leave her job and focus on recording music.[32] During one of the sessions Lipa co-wrote the song "Hotter than Hell",[32] which led to her signing a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 2014.[33][34] Millett retrospectively elaborated: "Dua was really smart–she signed to Warner Bros. partly because they didn't have a big female pop artist and they needed one. They really wanted her, so she had the focus of the team from day one."[32]

In August 2015, Lipa released her first single, "New Love",[35] produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt.[36] Her second single, "Be the One", was issued to European success in October 2015,[37][38] reaching number one in Belgium,[39] Poland and Slovakia, as well as charting in the top ten in over eleven European territories. In Australia and New Zealand, the song became an airplay success, reaching numbers 6 and 20 respectively.[40] In November 2015, she was revealed as one of the acts to appear on the BBC Sound of... 2016 long list.[41]

We've seen artists who might get half a good song out of 10 writing sessions; with Dua, one in five or one in four is a banger. She gets results out of other people as well, because her personality is so engaging and she is so charismatic. She definitely has that special something.

Artistry and influences
The media have described Lipa as having a mezzo-soprano[248][249][250] or contralto[251][252] vocal range. Her music is primarily pop, and has also been described as disco, house and R&B.[1][253][254] Stylistically, her music has been described as dance-pop,[255] synth-pop, R&B,[254] dream pop,[12] alternative pop,[256] and nu-disco subgenres.[257] She describes her musical style as being "dark pop".[38][258] She is also noted for singing in a "distinct, husky, low register",[24] and her "sultry" tone.[142] Regarding her songwriting process, Lipa states she usually comes to the studio with a concept and starts developing the song with her co-writers.[29][259] She cites Kylie Minogue, Pink, Nelly Furtado, Jamiroquai, Kendrick Lamar, and Chance the Rapper among her musical influences.[260][144][261] "My idea of pop has been P!nk and Christina Aguilera and Destiny's Child and Nelly Furtado", said Lipa in a GQ interview in 2018.[262] Her second studio album Future Nostalgia (2020) was inspired by artists that she listened to during her teens, including Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Moloko, Blondie and Outkast.[84]

Lipa's stage presence was met with criticism in the early stages of her career. A YouTube comment on her performance of "New Rules" at the 2018 BRIT Awards saying "I love her lack of energy, go girl give us nothing" became an internet meme, subjecting Lipa to ridicule. Lipa credited this criticism as motivation to improve her stage presence.[263][264][265]

A study conducted by the Office for National Statistics revealed that the number of people born with the name "Dua" in England and Wales was 63 in 2017, the year Lipa earned her first UK number one song with "New Rules"; this increased to 126 in 2019.[266][267] In May 2018, she was included on British Vogue's inaugural list of the 25 most influential British women of 2018 with Lipa being the youngest on the list at the age of 22. The magazine's review said her 2017 song "New Rules" is an "anthem of female empowerment [that] laid out a blueprint for modern sex lives", and described her as being a "culture definer".[268][269]

In February 2019, the first wax figure of Lipa was unveiled at Madame Tussauds London, inspired by her appearance during her performance at Glastonbury Festival 2017.[270][271] Two months later, a second wax figure sculpted of Lipa was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Amsterdam as an allusion to her performance at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards.[272]

Lyndsey Havens from Billboard credited Lipa as being the protagonist in disco's revival in 2020 through her song "Don't Start Now" (2019).[273] People magazine called her "the Future of Pop" due to the success of her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia.[274] She inspired the French photographer, Hugo Comte, in his first photo-book.[275] She was included in Time's 100 Next list on future 100 world's most influential people by Australian singer Kylie Minogue who in her review called Lipa a "shining star".[220][221] Mark Sutherland and Jem Aswad from Variety rated Lipa as being one of the most impactful women in the global entertainment industry.[276]

Lipa identifies as a feminist.[280] She has spoken out against sexism within the music industry, using social media to raise awareness of women's problems.[280][198] Lipa has advocated for social equality, for the LGBT community.[281] On 12 February 2018, she raised a rainbow flag while performing her song "Be the One" in a presentation at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles as part of The Self-Titled tour.[282] On the 2018 Brit Awards red carpet she wore a white rose dress in support of Time's Up movement.[283][284] Additionally at the same event, she stated in her acceptance speech for an award her delight of having "women present in these stages" and more "women winning awards".[285] She explained that her perception of feminism is not about misandry but demanding the same opportunities.[286] In September 2018, some fans were removed by security from a Lipa concert in the National Exhibition and Convention Center of Shanghai for allegedly waving rainbow flags, despite homosexuality being decriminalized in China in 1997.[287] In response, Lipa said she was "proud" of and "grateful" to the people who showed their pride at the show.[288]

In November 2018, Lipa expressed dissatisfaction over the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union due to Brexit because according to her personal experience "no refugee leaves their country without having to".[7] In June 2019, she made public her support for the ongoing Sudanese transition to democracy on social media by sharing a blue image that showed the phrase "Stand with Sudan" where she detailed her rejection of the Khartoum massacre writing about all "women, men and children fighting for a peaceful transition to democracy".[289] She said the event was an attempt to inflict "brutal murder and rape" by government forces on those who try to call for democracy, a "violation of the freedom rights" of Sudanese citizens for blocking their internet and a "violation of human rights".[289] In December of the same year, Lipa endorsed the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 United Kingdom general election, comparing the policies of both Labour and Conservatives on various issues on social media and affirming that it was "the most important election in a generation".[290] She characterized Boris Johnson's victory in the election as a "total disaster" for the UK.[291]

She participated in a short film for an initiative called "Global Feminism", directed by The Circle of Annie Lennox in association with Apple Music and released on 7 March 2019 ahead of International Women's Day. The clip intended to raise awareness of misogyny, rape, and violence against women.[292] In April 2019, she showed her support for LGBT rights in Brunei by calling for a boycott against the hotel interests of the then-Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, after a penal code punishing homosexuality with death came into force in Brunei.[293] During a Billboard Women in Music event, she used her Powerhouse Award acceptance speech to highlight that women "still have a lot to do for real equality" in which she also complained about the "lack of diversity" amongst the artists of the Billboard Hot 100 and asked for the continued encouragement to "all the young girls out there to be the powerhouses of the future."[285]

Lipa was the headliner party host for the 2020 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade and she was part of the parade,[294] before performing several songs.[295][296] In July 2020 she signed an open letter to the UK government being received by the then Minister for Women and Equalities, Liz Truss, to request the banning of conversion therapy.[297] Dua is in favor of universal health care and wonders why people weren't protesting about it. In addition, she said that in her country of birth, the United Kingdom, the National Health Service is considered a "right".[298] In June 2020, Lipa shared an Instagram post that criticised the Israel Defense Forces' treatment of Palestinians and showed Israeli soldiers detaining Palestinian minors.[299] The post also referred to "fake Jews in the Israeli government" and "fake Christians in the midwest [United States]" who it said had created Hamas for people to "believe that Hamas is the reason for the decades worth of occupation, oppression, ethnic cleansing, and murder."[300] An Im Tirtzu petition signed by over three thousand people was sent to the Israeli Minister of Defense, Benny Gantz, and the Israeli Minister of Culture and Sport, Hili Tropper, demanding that Lipa's songs be banned from Israeli Army Radio and Galgalatz due to what Im Tirtzu said was "the incitement against IDF soldiers, the antisemitism, the blood libel, conspiracy theories and the blatant lies in the post" shared by Lipa.[301][302] In response the Army Radio said that "Galgalatz does not boycott any artist" and "the songs are chosen at the discretion of the editors of each segment."[303][304]

In July 2020, Lipa supported a campaign called "Let the Music Play" in which she signed an open letter sent to the then-Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, calling for support from the government of United Kingdom for the UK's live music industry's economic loss under the COVID-19 pandemic.[305] On 18 July 2020, Lipa shared a post on her Instagram story explaining "why Kosovo is not and will never be Serbia", urging followers to sign a petition which called for Apple to include Kosovo in its mapping services as an independent state.[306] The next day, she published on her social media an image of a banner containing an irredentist map of Greater Albania that reflected parts of Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Greece and North Macedonia as one nation appended with the definition of the word "autochthonous".[307] As the banner is commonly associated with extreme Albanian nationalism,[307] she received backlash on social media where she was accused of ethnic nationalism and fascism.[308][309] She later said that her post had been "misinterpreted" by people who promote ethnic separatism, an ideology that she "completely rejects".[310] In August, she urged her Instagram followers to vote against Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election.[311]

After endorsing and campaigning for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primaries, Lipa expressed support for Joe Biden to become the U.S. president at a virtual event aimed at Albanian Americans later that year during the general election season, arguing that the Kosovars "owed" support to Biden because he was against the massacre and ethnic cleansing of Albanians by having supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.[312] In January 2021, she published a call to her Instagram followers to encourage Kosovo citizens to vote in the 2021 Kosovan parliamentary election.[313] In May 2021, after expressing solidarity for the death of Palestinian civilians due to the Israel–Palestine crisis, Lipa criticised The New York Times for publishing an advertisement characterizing her, along with Bella and Gigi Hadid, as antisemitic.[314] In July 2021, through her Sunny Hill Foundation, Lipa joined an initiative that was launched by the Municipality of Tirana, called "Adopt a Kindergarten". The aim of the project was to reconstruct a kindergarten that was severely damaged by the 2019 Albania earthquake. She said, "The kindergarten will be very beautiful and I am very proud that Sunny Hill Foundation is a part of it. Let's see better things for our country. I am very proud to be Albanian."[315] The kindergarten was completed in October 2021, and was named "Sunny Hill Kindergarten".[316]

Lipa has also continuously raised awareness to the detrimental consequences of the Taliban takeover of 2021 in Afghanistan through her social media and her lifestyle newsletter Service95.[317]

In August 2022, Lipa was named an Honorary Ambassador of Kosovo by the President of Kosovo Vjosa Osmani. In response, Lipa wrote that it was an "honor and a privilege to be able to represent my country all over the world" and that she supports the right of Kosovans "to visa liberalization, freedom to travel and to dream big."[318] On 13 November 2022, Lipa dismissed reports that she was to perform at the opening ceremony of that year's FIFA World Cup and denied ever being involved in any negotiation to perform, calling out the tournament's host country of Qatar for human rights violations.[319]

In October 2023, Lipa signed an open letter for the "Artists4Ceasefire" campaign alongside 185 other artists, urging President Joe Biden to push for a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid.[320] In November 2023, Israeli music duo Ness & Stilla released the single "Harbu Darbu",[321] which called for Dua Lipa's death.[322]

Philanthropy
She and her father, Dukagjin, co-created the Sunny Hill Foundation in 2016 to raise funds to help people in Kosovo experiencing financial difficulties. In August 2018, Dua Lipa organized a festival to raise money for the foundation called the Sunny Hill Festival. The then-Mayor of Pristina, Shpend Ahmeti, awarded her the Pristina Key, the first time one had been awarded.[323] Lipa went on to host the festival for the second year in 2019, with Miley Cyrus included as part of the performer line-up.[324] In mid-November 2018, Lipa was part of a campaign organised by UNICEF called "Go Blue" in support of children's rights, on the occasion of World Children's Day (20 November).[325] Her contribution consisted of a short video about dressing in blue or displaying the colour blue, with her in a studio re-recording the lyrics of her song "Be the One" (2015). She changed the word "red" to "blue" in the song for the occasion.[326][327] In December 2018, Lipa participated in a benefit concert for the Ellie Goulding's "Streets of London" annual charity event at Wembley Arena, which "funds specialist support for people who are homeless in London and raises awareness about homelessness."[328][329] In April 2019, she became an UNICEF supporter during a three-day visit to a camp for refugee children and youth in Beirut, Lebanon.[330] The camp included many uprooted by the conflict in Syria who did not have "adequate" health care or education and Lipa also visited young Palestinians and Syrians in Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp.[331] She subsequently supported a campaign by her management company with a plan to raise £100,000 to help raise awareness of charities such as The Black Dog and CALM.[332]

She asked for a better mental health care for artists in creative industries, as she was "shocked" to read that "suicide rates amongst women working in the arts are almost 70% higher than in the world population". Lipa described mental health as the "issue of our generation".[333] On 26 November 2019, following the 2019 Albania earthquake, Lipa asked fans for donations and support for victims.[334][335] To raise funds she co-released a limited edition line of t-shirts called "Pray for Albania" in collaboration with Albanian fashion designers. All of the proceeds went to families and victims affected by the seismic event.[336][337] On 15 March 2020, she asked her fans to make donations to the UNHCR agency to deal with COVID-19 pandemic because refugees are "the most vulnerable on this planet" and they "often live in crowded places" with "limited health services".[338][339] In the same month, she was part of a television special called "Home Fest" on The Late Late Show with James Corden From His Garage with the goal of raising money for CDC and Feed the Children where she performed her song, "Don't Start Now" (2019), from an apartment in London.[340] On 16 May 2020, she did a live performance of her song "Break My Heart" (2020) on the television special Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020 aimed at the high school students whose graduation ceremonies and proms were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[341] At the end of May 2020, she participated in a digital event called "Dream with Us" with the aim of raising funds,[342] whose event consisted of a streaming concert at which a portion of proceeds would go to organizations which help fight COVID-19.[343]

She took part of a charitable project operated by BBC Radio 1 for a cover version of "Times Like These" released on 23 April 2020 for the Live Lounge segment.[344] She was part of the charity supergroup Live Lounge Allstars in which each member recorded and filmed their contribution to the song from their respective households to encourage social distancing in which profits from the single would primarily go to Children in Need and Comic Relief, as well as COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[345] She used social media to encourage Lebanese citizens to donate blood to victims affected by the 2020 Beirut explosion.[346] She donated 5,000 euros to the Theatre of Dodona so that the venue could have its own ticket system and website.[347] She was part of an initiative organized by Belgian singer Angèle and KickCancer Foundation to fund research against childhood cancer, and it was about a charity raffle in which Lipa offered a manuscript of her song "Don't Start Now" (2019) as a prize.[348][349] She performed at 2021 Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party virtually to benefit the AIDS Foundation to combat HIV disease, whose event raised US$3 million.[350]

Personal life
Lipa's first name "Dua" was her grandmother's suggestion and means "love" in Albanian.[7] She is occasionally referred to affectionately by fans as "Dula Peep", which originated as a mispronunciation by American talk show host Wendy Williams in 2018.[351] Since then she has positively embraced the nickname.[352]

Lipa's native language is Albanian.[5] She was born and grew up mostly in London and has a London accent when speaking English.[353]

Lipa has described herself as an "honorary Liverpool supporter", after her song "One Kiss" was adopted by the football club's fans in the wake of her performance at the 2018 UEFA Champions League final, since becoming a Reds anthem after significant Liverpool victories.[354][355][356] On 27 November 2022, Lipa was granted Albanian citizenship by president Bajram Begaj, one day before the country's 110th independence celebrations.[357][358]
