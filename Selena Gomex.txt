Selena Marie Gomez (/səˈliːnə ˈɡoʊmɛz/ sə-LEE-nə GOH-mez; born July 22, 1992) is an American singer, actress, producer, and businesswoman. She began her career as a child actress, starring on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004). Gomez rose to prominence and emerged as a teen idol, for her leading role as Alex Russo on the Disney Channel sitcom Wizards of Waverly Place (2007–2012). She signed with Hollywood Records in 2008. As the lead vocalist, she formed the pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene, and released three studio albums from 2009 to 2011; each of the band's releases have been certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Further pursuing a career as a soloist, Gomez found continued success with her solo studio albums as each debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 upon release. Her EDM-inspired debut, Stars Dance (2013) yielded the international top-ten single "Come & Get It". Desiring more artistic control, Gomez signed with Interscope Records and released the electropop set Revival in 2015, supported by the top-ten singles "Good for You", "Same Old Love", and "Hands to Myself". The follow-up, Rare (2020), topped the charts in eleven countries, and was led by the single "Lose You to Love Me", which marked Gomez's first number-one song on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100. She forayed into Spanish-language music with the EP Revelación (2021), which earned her career-first Grammy Award nomination. Gomez has also released various collaborative singles, including "We Don't Talk Anymore", "It Ain't Me", "Wolves", "Taki Taki", and "Calm Down (Remix)"; the latter became the most commercially successful Afrobeats song of all time.

Gomez has starred in numerous films, including voicing Mavis in the Hotel Transylvania film franchise (2012–2022). On television, she produced the teen drama series 13 Reasons Why (2017–2020), the documentary Living Undocumented (2019), her cooking show Selena + Chef (2020–present), and the mystery comedy series Only Murders in the Building (2021–present), in which she plays a lead acting role. Gomez has received numerous accolades, including an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, and 16 Guinness World Records; and received nominations for four Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Latin Grammy Award nomination.

Outside of music and acting, Gomez has worked with various charitable organizations, and advocates for mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality; she has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2009. She launched the cosmetics company Rare Beauty in 2020, which was valued at $2 billion in 2024,[1] and founded the Rare Impact Fund, a non-profit committed to raising $100 million this decade for mental health awareness. Gomez has been featured in listicles such as the Time 100 (2020) and Forbes 30 Under 30 (2016 and 2020), and was named the Billboard Woman of the Year in 2017. Billboard ranked her as one of the most successful artists of the 2010s decade. With over 430 million followers, she is the most-followed woman on Instagram, as of 2024.

Early life
Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas,[2] to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Texas-born[3] former stage actress Mandy Teefey.[4] She was named after Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who died in 1995.[5][6] Her father is of Mexican descent, while her mother, who was adopted, has Italian ancestry.[7][8][9] Gomez's paternal grandparents emigrated to Texas from Monterrey in the 1970s.[10] Of her heritage, Gomez has said she is "a proud third-generation American-Mexican"[11] and "My family does have quinceañeras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."[12] Gomez's Spanish fluency wained after age seven, when she began working in television.[10] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[4][13] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[14][15] and Victoria "Tori" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[16] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[17]

Gomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[18] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[19] Gomez has said, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[20] She later added that her mother "was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me." Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they "raised her" until she found success in show business.[21]

Career
2002–2006: Career beginnings
Gomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[22] In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends,[23][24] portraying the character Gianna.[25] The show was her first acting gig. Gomez recalled of the experience, "I was very shy when I was little [...] I didn't know what 'camera right' was. I didn't know what blocking was. I learned everything from Barney."[26] Gomez appeared in thirteen episodes of the show between 2002 and 2004; the show's producers released her as she was "too old" for the series.[26] While working on Barney & Friends, Gomez had bit part roles in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and the made-for-television film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005).[27][28] She guest starred in a 2006 episode of the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[29][28]

2007–2012: Breakthrough with Disney and Selena Gomez & the Scene

Gomez was given a recurring role on the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana in 2007 as pop star Mikayla.[26] During this time, Gomez filmed pilot episodes for two potential Disney Channel series; the first was a Suite Life spin-off titled Arwin!,[30] and the second was a Lizzie McGuire spin-off titled What's Stevie Thinking?.[31][32] She later auditioned for a role in the network's series Wizards of Waverly Place, ultimately winning the lead role of Alex Russo.[26] Gomez and her mother subsequently moved to Los Angeles.[24] Wizards of Waverly Place saw Gomez playing a teenage girl in a family of wizards who own a restaurant in New York City.[33] It quickly became a success for the Disney Channel and represented Gomez's breakthrough into the mainstream.[34] The role brought Gomez "teen idol" status.[35][36] And she also became one of the ten highest-paid children's TV stars of all time, earning from US$25,000-30,000 per episode.[37][38] The series received numerous awards and nominations,[39][40] and won the Outstanding Children's Program at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards.[41] It garnered positive reviews,[42][43] with Gomez's being particularly praised for her comic timing and sarcastic delivery.[42][44][45]

In 2008, while working on the second season of her series, Gomez voiced Helga along with Jim Carrey, Steve Carell and others in the animated film Horton Hears a Who!.[46] The film became a commercial and critical success,[47] grossing over US$300 million worldwide.[48] In September of the same year, the teen musical comedy film Another Cinderella Story was released, where Gomez played the main role of an aspiring dancer Mary Santiago, the film became the second installment of the A Cinderella Story series, released on direct-to-video.[49] Gomez recorded three songs for the soundtrack album, including the single "Tell Me Something I Don't Know"-which became Gomez's first entry on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100,[50] and the premiere of the music video was on MTV's Total Request Live.[51] This role earned Gomez a Young Artist Award.[52] She also recorded the original song "Fly to Your Heart" for the soundtrack album of the animated film Tinker Bell (2008).[53] In 2008, at age 16, Gomez signed with Hollywood Records,[54][55] and formed her own production company, July Moon Production.[56] She partnered with XYZ Films for the project, allowing Gomez to option articles, hire writers and create talent packages to shop to studios.[56][57] Gomez was slated to release two films under the company. The first, titled What Boys Want, would feature Gomez as a girl who could hear the thoughts of men.[58] She later announced a film adaptation of the novel Thirteen Reasons Why, in which she was to play a young girl who commits suicide; ultimately, neither film was made,[59] but later, Gomez will produce a television adaptation of this novel.[60]

Gomez continued to enjoy mainstream success throughout the following year, appearing as Alex Russo in a crossover episode of the Disney Channel series The Suite Life on Deck in 2009.[61] She also guest starred as herself on the Disney Channel series Sonny with a Chance.[62] Gomez, along with Demi Lovato, starred in the Disney Channel film Princess Protection Program, which aired in June 2009.[63] The film had a total of 8.5 million viewers during its premiere.[64] For the film's soundtrack, the pair recorded the song "One and the Same", which charted at number eighty-second in the U.S.[50] She next starred in Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, a television film based on the series.[65] The film premiered in August to an audience of 11.4 million viewers, becoming cable's number-one scripted telecast of the year and was the second-most watched TV movie on cable, behind High School Musical 2.[66][67][68] Roxana Hadadi of The Washington Post credited all three performers—Gomez, David Henrie and Jake T. Austin—for their "acting skills that carry the film".[69] The film won the series its second consecutive Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[70] Gomez recorded three songs on the television series and film's soundtrack, including the single "Magic",[71][72] which reached number sixty-one in the U.S.[50] She then voiced Princess Selenia in the English-language French animated/live-action film Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard (2009).[73]

Hoping to cross over into the music industry, Gomez formed the pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene through her record deal with Hollywood Records.[74] The name of the band is an "ironic jab" at the people who called Gomez a "wannabe scene".[75] The band's debut studio album, Kiss & Tell, influenced by pop rock and electronic rock was released in September 2009.[76][77] The album received mixed reviews from critics,[77] BBC News described the album as "[...] fast and full of energy [...]",[78] and Mikael Wood from Billboard wrote: "[...] her music could use more of her in it".[76] Kiss & Tell debuted at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 66,000 album-equivalent units,[79] and spent a non-consecutive 59 weeks there.[80] Although its lead single was not commercially and critically successful,[50] the second single, "Naturally", became a breakthrough and the first highly successful single in Gomez's career, reaching number twenty-nine in the U.S.,[50] and top-ten in many European countries,[81] including number seven in the U.K..[82] In a 2021 Grammy interview, Gomez credited the LGBT community for kickstarting her music career and supporting her before anyone else, stating "I remember when it was released, it truly started getting played in gay bars before anywhere else", and expressed her gratitude for the community. "I hope they hear in my music the importance of self-love and the strength that comes through vulnerability"-Gomez said, adding that she has always truly loved and supported gays since childhood.[83] All studio albums and singles of the band were certified gold or higher by the RIAA.[84] In July 2010, Gomez starred alongside Joey King in Ramona and Beezus, a film adaptation of the children's novel series by Beverly Cleary, in which she portrayed Beezus Quimby.[85][86] The film was well received by critics;[87] Roger Ebert described it as "a sweet salute", and found both actresses "appealing".[88] Gomez later reprised the voice role of Princess Selenia in Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds (2010).[89] The band's second studio album, A Year Without Rain, inspired by dance-pop and synth-pop, was released in September 2010.[90] Basically, the album was not poorly appreciated by critics,[91] many of whom called it the effort was an improvement over 2009's Kiss & Tell.[92] The album debuted at number four on the U.S., with first-week sales of over 66,000 album-equivalent units,[90] and also debuted at number six in Canada.[93] Both of the record's singles, "Round & Round" and "A Year Without Rain", achieved moderate success.[50] The band was awarded Favorite Breakout Artist at the 37th People's Choice Awards.[94]

Selena Gomez & the Scene released their third and final, as well as most successful studio album, When the Sun Goes Down, in June 2011.[95] The album received mixed reviews from critics,[95] who praised the album's production and described it as "[...] is a very professional affair",[96] the album also was co-written by Britney Spears and Katy Perry.[96] It debuted at number four on the U.S. with first-week sales of 78,000 album-equivalent units, reaching number three the following week,[97] as well as reaching number two in Canada and Spain.[98] Its lead single, "Who Says", was the band's highest charting effort, peaking at number twenty-one in the U.S.[50] Its second single, "Love You like a Love Song", although it did not reach great heights in the charts, reaching only number twenty-two in the U.S. and spending 38 consecutive weeks there,[50] as well as reaching the top-ten in Canada,[99] and topping the chart in Russia,[100] but became a worldwide hit and one of the most successful, best-selling and popular songs in Gomez's career.[101] Alex Frank from Pitchfork called the song "a cult karaoke classic".[102] In 2022, Billboard ranked the song as the biggest song that peaked at number twenty-two of all time.[103] For two years in a row (2010–2011), Billboard magazine ranked Gomez third in their list of 21 Under 21: Music's Hottest Minors, an annual ranking of the most popular musicians under the age of 21.[104][105]

Gomez starred in the comedy film Monte Carlo (2011), with Leighton Meester and Katie Cassidy;[106][107] she played the lead role of Grace, a teenager "mistaken for a socialite", Cordelia (also Gomez), "while on a trip to Paris".[106][107] In preparation for the role, she learned to play polo and received dialect coaching to speak in two different British accents;[108][109] Gomez's accent was described as "unconvincing".[110] The film received mixed reviews from critic.[111] Nick Schager from Slant Magazine found Gomez "cute, but too bland to lend the proceedings any vivid character, except for the few scenes that allow her to indulge her cold, sarcastic, nasty side as Cordelia".[112] That year, Gomez appeared in a cameo role in the film The Muppets.[113] Gomez hosted in June the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto, Canada, and in November the MTV Europe Music Awards in Belfast, Northern Ireland.[114][115]

2012–2014: Stars Dance and films
Gomez confirmed in January 2012 that she would be taking a break from music, placing Selena Gomez & the Scene on hiatus.[116] That year, Wizards of Waverly Place officially ended its run on the Disney Channel after four seasons.[117][118] For five years in a row (2009-2013), Gomez won the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite TV Actress. She currently holds the record for the most Kids' Choice Awards wins (12) for an individual.[119][120] In 2012, Gomez starred in the controversial comedy-crime film from director Harmony Korine Spring Breakers together with James Franco, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine.[121] The film premiered at the 69th Venice International Film Festival,[122] and was released the following year.[123] The story followed four college-aged girls who decide to rob a fast food restaurant in order to pay for their spring break.[124] It saw Gomez playing a more mature character than she did previously and reportedly led to her having a "bit of a meltdown on set".[13] Spring Breakers received positive reviews from critics,[125] some called it a potential cult classic.[126] The film entered many prestigious ratings,[127] including the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and Rolling Stone's The 50 Best Movies of the 2010s and many others.[128] Many critics and tabloids were shocked to see the "teen idol" Miss Gomez in such a provocative film, in particular Manohla Dargis from The New York Times wrote: it is not surprising that Miss Gomez quit Disney. "In "Spring Breakers" [she] have the chance to simulate the behavior that feeds the tabloids without the humiliations and career-crushing price paid [...]".[129]

In February 2012, Gomez received the voice role of Mavis Dracula in the animated film Hotel Transylvania.[130] In September of the same year, the film premiered at the 37th annual Toronto International Film Festival,[131] and was released in theaters the same month.[132] The film received mixed reviews from critics, some calling it "buoyant" and some "[...] a little too loud and thinly-scripted for older audiences".[133] Hotel Transylvania was commercially successful, grossing US$358 million worldwide.[134] In 2013, Gomez starred alongside Ethan Hawke in the action thriller film Getaway, in which she played a young hacker.[135] The film was a critical and commercial failure.[136] This role earned her the first and only nomination for the Worst Actress at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards.[137] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic described her as "a kid trying desperately to act like a grownup, but with no real idea what that might entail".[138] In 2013, she was executive producer and star in a special The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex on the Disney Channel.[139]

Despite earlier claims that she would be taking a break from music, Gomez announced in March 2013 the release of her solo debut album.[117] In April 2013, Gomez released "Come & Get It" as the lead single for her upcoming album.[140] This song became Gomez's first top-ten entry on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, reaching number six,[141] and also reached the top-ten on the charts in Canada and the U.K.[142] The album's second single, "Slow Down", peaked at number twenty-seven in the U.S.[50] Gomez released her debut solo studio album, Stars Dance, in July 2013.[143] The style of the record was rooted musically on EDM and electropop.[144] It received mixed reviews from music critics.[145] Writing for Los Angeles Times, August Brown found that the album was "the kind of album one makes in 2013 if you want to keep the pop sugar of the Disney tween cabal but mix in some broken glass and a club bathroom nosebleed. Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode [...]".[144] Andrew Hampp of Billboard wrote: "[...] is a collection of 11 shinily produced pop songs that find Gomez trying on a series of different personalities with her slight-yet-capable vocals [...]".[145] Stars Dance became her first album to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 97,000 album-equivalent units.[97] At that time, Gomez, who turned 21, became the youngest solo artist to take first place since Speak Now from Taylor Swift in 2010.[97] The album also reached number one in Canada.[93] Gomez incorporated choreographed dance routines into the album's music videos and her promotional live performances, having been inspired by artists such as Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.[146][147] The music video of "Come & Get It" won the Best Pop Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[148]

In August 2013, Gomez embarked on her first solo worldwide concert tour, Stars Dance Tour, to further promote Stars Dance, with shows in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.[149] In December 2013, Gomez canceled the Australian and Asian legs of the tour, claiming that she would be taking a hiatus to spend time with her family.[150] In January 2014, it was reported that Gomez had spent two weeks at Dawn at The Meadows, which is a treatment center in Wickenburg, Arizona, that specializes in treating addiction and trauma in young people.[151] Her representative stated that she had spent time there "voluntarily [...] but not for substance abuse".[152][153] Gomez confirmed in 2015 that she had been diagnosed with lupus and that after canceling the tour she entered rehab to undergo chemotherapy.[154][155] Gomez played Nina Pennington, an innocent straight-A student, in Behaving Badly (2014).[156][157] The project, filmed prior to Gomez's stint in rehab, was released in August to a generally negative critical and commercial reception.[158][159] However, critics deemed Gomez's performance superior to the film.[160][161] Gomez also had a supporting role in the drama Rudderless (2014), the directorial debut of William H. Macy.[162][163] The independent film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival,[162] and received a mixed reception from critics.[164][165] At the 2014 Teen Choice Awards, Gomez was honored with the Ultimate Choice Award for her "contributions to the entertainment world".[166] Currently, with 18 wins, she is the fourth-most awarded solo artist at the Teen Choice Awards.[167] Seventeen also named her "the most powerful girl under 21" in 2014.[168]

In April 2014, Gomez had fired her mother and stepfather as her managers, who had served in those roles since her career at Disney.[169] Gomez later signed with two new talent agencies, WMA and Brillstein, to manage her career.[170] The Hollywood Reporter informed: "Selena's desire to find fresh handlers is part of a strategy to "move on into more adult-oriented fare in film and music"", and finally get rid of the image of the "Disney's Teen Idol".[171] The news about Gomez's new management fueled rumors that her contract with Hollywood Records was coming to an end.[172] In November 2014, Gomez surprise-released her new single "The Heart Wants What It Wants", and confirmed after months of speculation that she would be releasing a compilation album to complete her contract with her label.[172] The single became her second top-ten hit in the U.S.,[50] and reached the top-ten in Canada.[99] In the same month, Gomez released her first solo compilation album of her greatest hits, For You, which also includes three brand new songs.[173] The album debuted at number twenty-four on the U.S. Billboard 200,[80] earning 35,506 album-equivalent units in its first week.[174] Gomez officially parted ways with Hollywood Records and later signed with Interscope Records in December 2014.[175]

2015–2016: Revival
While working on her second studio album, Gomez collaborated with German DJ Zedd on "I Want You to Know", released in February 2015,[176] and debuted at number-seventeen in the U.S.[50] In May, she appeared in Taylor Swift's music video for "Bad Blood".[177] Gomez released "Good for You" featuring rapper ASAP Rocky as the lead single from her second studio album, in June.[178] The song debuted at number-one on the Digital Songs chart with first-week sales of 179,000 copies—the best sales week in Gomez's career for a single. It was the chart's first number-one debut since Swift's "Blank Space" (2014).[179] "Good for You" became Gomez's first top-five single on the Billboard Hot 100, and her first single to top the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[180] It also reached the top-ten on charts in Australia and Canada.[181] Gomez later reprised the voice role of Mavis in Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015); the film was met with a positive critical reception and commercial success upon release,[182] grossing US$474 million worldwide.[183] She was awarded Favorite Animated Movie Voice at the 42nd People's Choice Awards.[184]


Gomez performing on The Today Show in 2015
Gomez released her second studio album, Revival, in October 2015.[185] It is primarily a dance-pop and electropop record with R&B vibes.[186][187] The album was reviewed positively by critics, who praised its production and lyrical content.[188] Writing for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos stated that "Revival is an audacious name for a 23-year-old singer's second album, but from start to finish, Gomez earns it," noting that "[t]his is the sound of a newly empowered pop artist growing into her strengths like never before."[189] Kristen S.Hé of Billboard called it "one of the most influential pop albums of the late 2010s."[190] The album debuted at number-one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 117,000 album units,[191] and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[192] It remains Gomez's highest first-week sales to date.[191] "Same Old Love" was released as the album's second single and topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[193][194] It also peaked at number-five in the U.S., tying with "Good for You" as Gomez's highest-charting single at the time,[50] and reached the top-ten in Canada.[99] "Hands to Myself" served as the album's third single and became her third consecutive number-one on the Mainstream Top 40,[195] making Gomez one of only six female artists to have three singles from the same album top the chart.[196] The single also peaked within the top-ten in the U.S.,[50] and the top-five in Canada.[99] For her performance on Billboard's music charts, Gomez received the Chart-Topper Award at the 2015 Billboard Women in Music event.[197]

In October 2008, Gomez participated in St. Jude's Children's Hospital's "Runway For Life" benefit.[508] That same month, Gomez was named UNICEF's spokesperson for the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign, which encouraged children to raise money on Halloween to help children around the world.[509] In August 2009, Gomez, then 17 years old, became the youngest UNICEF ambassador (Millie Bobby Brown later surpassed this record).[510][511] In her first official field mission, Gomez traveled to Ghana in September 2009 for one week to witness first-hand the stark conditions of vulnerable children that lack vital necessities such as clean water, nourishment, education and healthcare.[512][513] Gomez explained in an interview with Associated Press correspondents that she wanted to use her star power to bring awareness to Ghana: "That's why I feel very honored to have a voice that kids listen to and take into consideration [...] I had people on my tour asking me where IS Ghana, and they Googled it [...] and because I went there, they now know where Ghana is. So it's pretty incredible."[513][514] Gomez said, of her role as ambassador, that "Every day 25,000 children die from preventable causes. I stand with UNICEF in the belief that we can change that number from 25,000 to zero. I know we can achieve this because every moment, UNICEF is on the ground providing children with the lifesaving assistance needed to ensure zero becomes a reality."[512]

Gomez was named spokesperson for UNICEF's 2009 Trick-or-Treat campaign for the second year in a row.[515] She raised over $700,000 for the charity in 2008 and stated that she hopes to be able to raise US$1 million in 2009.[513] Gomez participated in a celebrity auction[516] and hosted a live web cast series on Facebook in support of the Trick-or-Treat campaign.[517] She returned as the UNICEF spokesperson for the 60th anniversary of Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign in 2010.[518] In celebration of the organization's 60th anniversary, Gomez and the Scene held a benefit concert, donating all proceeds to the campaign.[519] Gomez also encouraged teenagers to donate via social media.

In February 2011, Gomez traveled to Chile to meet with the families of the UNICEF-supported "Programa Puente", which helped families better understand and develop skills to deal with early childhood education, development, and other issues related to raising children. Gomez remarked that "UNICEF is helping Chilean families get out of poverty, prevent violence within the home and promote education. To witness first hand these families' struggles, and also their hope and perseverance, was truly inspiring".[521] In March, Gomez participated in the UNICEF Tap Project's "Celebrity Tap Pack" which featured limited-edition, custom-made water bottles with tap water from the homes of each celebrity advocate to raise funds and increase profile for the clean water and sanitation programs.[522] All the funds raised (the campaign raised $900,000) made it possible to provide clean, safe drinking water to children in Vietnam, Togo, Mauritania, and Cameroon- countries where it's desperately needed.[523][524] She was also featured in videos that promoted the campaign.[525][526] In April 2012, she advocated for the global "Sound the Alarm" campaign on Facebook and Twitter, and recorded a public announcement encouraging young people to donate $10 via text message to prevent the death of a million children from malnutrition in the Sahel Region of West and Central Africa.[527]
